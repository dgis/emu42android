DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu42 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu42 source code remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu42 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e??) than the original Windows application!

Some KML files with theirs faceplates are embedded in the application but it is still possible to open a KML file and its dependencies by selecting a folder.

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
https://github.com/dgis/emu42android


QUICK START

1. From the left side, slide your finger to open the menu.
2. Touch the "New..." menu item.
3. Select a predefined faceplate (or select a custom KML script folder).
4. And the calculator should now be opened.


NOTES

- When using a custom KML script by selecting a folder, you must take care of the case sensitivity of its dependency files.
