DESCRIPTION

This project ports the Windows application Emu42 written in C to Android.
It uses the Android NDK. The former Emu42 source code remains untouched because of a thin win32 emulation layer above Linux/NDK!
This win32 layer will allow to easily update from the original Emu42 source code.
It can open or save the exact same state files (state.e??) than the original Windows application!

This application does NOT come with the ROM files!
You will need KML scripts and ROM files already copied into your Android filesystem.
You can download the KML scripts from the original Emu42 Windows application archive (https://hp.giesselink.com/emu42.htm)
and you can extract the ROM file from a real calculator (or be lucky on internet).
Be careful about the case sensitivity of the filename in the KML script (Linux is case sensitive, not Windows).

The application does not request any permission (because it opens the files or the KML folders using the content:// scheme).

The application is distributed with the same license under GPL and you can find the source code here:
https://github.com/dgis/emu42android


QUICK START

1. From the left side, slide your finger to open the menu.
2. Touch the "New..." menu item.
3. "Select a Custom KML script folder..." where you have copied the KML scripts and ROM files.
4. And the calculator should now be opened.


NOTES

- When using a custom KML script by selecting a folder, you must take care of the case sensitivity of its dependency files.
- This Emulator does not include the ROM files or the KML files.

BUILD

Emu42 for Android is built with Android Studio 3.4 (2019).
And to generate an installable APK file with a real Android device, it MUST be signed.

Either use Android Studio:
* In menu "Build"
* Select "Generate Signed Bundle / APK..."
* Select "APK", then "Next"
* "Create new..." (or use an existing key store file)
* Enter "Key store password", "Key alias" and "Key password", then "Next"
* Select a "Destination folder:"
* Select the "Build Variants:" "release"
* Select the "Signature Versions:" "V1" (V1 only)
* Finish

Or in the command line, build the signed APK:
* In the root folder, create a keystore.jks file with:
** keytool -genkey -keystore ./keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -validity 9125 -alias key0
** (keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore ./keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -validity 9125 -alias key0)
* create the file ./keystore.properties , with the following properties:
    storeFile=../keystore.jks
    storePassword=myPassword
    keyAlias=key0
    keyPassword=myPassword
* gradlew build
* The APK should be in the folder app/build/outputs/apk/release

Then, you should be able to use this fresh APK file with an Android device.
